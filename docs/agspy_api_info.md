# AquaSpy AgSpy API Overview
> [!NOTE]
> üõë **TL;DR**: Integration is paused due to lack of in-season probes. Site IDs must be hardcoded, and no sensor data can be retrieved until AquaSpy hardware is deployed and activated in-season.


### AquaSpy Integration Note

While AquaSpy exposes structured data over a web service, it does **not provide a conventional REST API**. The platform relies on fixed URLs with known site IDs, returns JSON embedded inside XML, and does not support authenticated user-based access or site discovery. We treat this as a static data feed rather than a dynamic, queryable API (e.g., no resource discovery, no user-level auth, no POST methods).


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AquaSpy API Integration Status

The AquaSpy API integration is currently **on hold** due to deployment and platform constraints. Below is a summary of the current issues preventing full functionality:

---

### ‚ùå Current Limitations

1. **No Sensors Currently Deployed**
   - None of the monitored sites have AquaSpy sensors actively installed.
   - As a result, `InSeason = False` and `CurrentFieldSeasonID = null` for all known `siteID`s.
   - This prevents any historical or real-time sensor data from being accessed via the API.

2. **Season Dependency for Data Access**
   - The AquaSpy API requires that a site be marked as `InSeason = True` and have a valid `CurrentFieldSeasonID` to access:
     - `GetSeasonApiData` ‚Äì full seasonal time series
     - `GetSeasonDifferentialApiData` ‚Äì incremental updates
   - `GetSeasonApiData` returns `null` if no `CurrentFieldSeasonID` exists.
   - `GetSeasonDifferentialApiData` cannot run without a valid timestamp from an in-season probe.

3. **Site ID Discovery is Manual**
   - The API provides **no method to list all `siteID`s** accessible by a user.
   - Site IDs must be known in advance and manually entered in the script.
   - This is unlike other platforms (e.g., IrriMAX or GroGuru) that support logger/site discovery via authenticated API calls.

---

### ‚úÖ Resolution Path (When Sensors Are Active)

When AquaSpy sensors are deployed and a season is defined via the AquaSpy dealer portal:

- `get_site_metadata(site_id)` will return a valid `CurrentFieldSeasonID`.
- `get_season_data(season_id)` and `get_differential_data(season_id, timestamp)` will return valid time-series data.

Until that point, the AquaSpy script will remain functional for metadata retrieval only, with data methods inactive.

---

### TODO

- Revisit AquaSpy integration after sensor deployment and in-season activation.
- Explore automation options for `siteID` discovery through internal records or support contact.

## Example of Problem
```python
In [8]: # all sesnor IDs
   ...: site_ids = [33853, 33856, 30759, 33857, 33858, 33859, 30756, 33860,
   ...:             33861, 33862, 34533, 33863, 30757, 33854, 33855, 30758]
   ...:
   ...: for sid in site_ids:
   ...:     try:
   ...:         m = get_site_metadata(sid)
   ...:         if m["CurrentFieldSeasonID"]:
   ...:             print(f"‚úÖ Site {sid} ({m['SiteDesc']}): SeasonID = {m['CurrentFieldSeasonID']}")
   ...:         else:
   ...:             print(f"‚õî Site {sid} ({m['SiteDesc']}): No Season ID")
   ...:     except Exception as e:
   ...:         print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Site {sid} failed: {e}")

}
```

**Notes:**

- Indices are zero-based

- Sensor depths and moisture percentages are in customer‚Äôs preferred units (`DepthUnit`).

- % values are expressed as fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0.

- Root Depth and Last Irrigation Depth can be calculated as follows from `RootDepthSensorIndex` and `LastIrrigationDepthSensorIndex`, provided these are not null, as follows:

```bash
((RootDepthSensorIndex - UpperActiveSensorIndex) * SensorInterval) + InstallDepth
((LastIrrigationDepthSensorIndex - UpperActiveSensorIndex) * SensorInterval) + InstallDepth
```

## `GetSeasonApiData` and `GetSeasonDifferentialApiData` Methods

These methods retrieve **historical sensor data** for the current season of an AgSpy Site.

- Both require the `fieldSeasonID` parameter, which is obtained from the `CurrentFieldSeasonID` field in the `GetSiteApiData` response.
- **`GetSeasonApiData`** returns **all** sensor readings since the beginning of the season. Use it once to initialize your data store.
- **`GetSeasonDifferentialApiData`** returns **only new readings** after a given timestamp. Use it repeatedly for incremental updates.

### Response Structure (shared by both methods):

```json
{
    "Success": [boolean],                           // Indicates if the call was successful
    "HasPublicMessage": [boolean],                  
    "Messages": [string[]],                         // Provides info about exception, if encountered
    "Data": {
        "SiteID": [int],                            
        "FieldSeasonID": [int],
        "ReferenceTimestamp": "[datetime?]",
        "MaxReadTimestampUTC": "[datetime]",        // The timestamp of the most recent sensor readings
        "SeasonData": [                             // An array of sets of readings
            {
                "[datetime]": {                     // The timestamp of a set of readings
                    "M": [double[]],                // The moisture values of the reading, indexed from top to bottom sensor
                    "E": [double[]],                // The Ec values of the reading
                    "T": [double[]],                // The temperature values of the reading
                    "SM": [double],                 // The moisture summary value (%)
                    "SE": [double]                  // The Ec summary value
                }
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

### Notes:

- **Keys inside `SeasonData`** are timestamps (`datetime`) of the reading.

- Each reading block includes:
  - `"M"`: Moisture readings (top to bottom sensor)
  - `"E"`: Electrical conductivity (EC) values
  - `"T"`: Temperature values
  - `"SM"`: Moisture summary (%)
  - `"SE"`: EC summary value

- **Truncated arrays**: The arrays for `"M"`, `"E"`, and `"T"` will **only include active sensors**, meaning sensors above ground or otherwise excluded will not appear.

- **Incremental updating**:  
  Use the value from `MaxReadTimestampUTC` as your `referenceTimestamp` in subsequent calls to `GetSeasonDifferentialApiData`. This ensures only new data is pulled.

- **URL encoding required**:  
  `referenceTimestamp` must be URL-encoded when used in request parameters (e.g., convert `:` to `%3A`).

- **First call strategy**:  
  - Use `GetSeasonApiData` **once** to retrieve full season history.
  - Then switch to `GetSeasonDifferentialApiData` for all **future incremental pulls**.
